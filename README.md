# Honours-Project - The Development of a 3D Game with a Time Loop Mechanic

This Project was created by Jamie Fergus for his final year project(2022-2023) at the Univercity of Dundee

The aim of this project was to create a unique 3D 
game, utilising a time loop mechanic, and to understand 
what goes into game development. Inspiration was taken 
from other game featuring time loop mechanics e.g., Outer 
Wilds, The Legend of Zelda, and games such as Superhot 
and Neon White.
